You may have recorded this \\ndata in an indexed address book or you may have stored it on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such \\nas Microsoft Access or Excel. This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database. \\nA database has the following implicit properties: \\n\\uf0fc A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld or the universe \\nofdiscourse (UoD). Changes to the miniworldare reflected in the database.  \\n\\uf0fc A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data \\ncannot correctly be referred to as a database. \\n\\uf0fc A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users \\nand some preconceived applications in which these users are interested. \\nOther properties: \\n\\uf0fc A database can be of any size and complexity .For example, the list of names and addresses referred to earlier \\nmay consist o f only a few hundred records, each with a simple structure.An example of a large commercial \\ndatabase is Amazon.com. \\n\\uf0fc A database may be generated and maintained manually or it may be computerized . For example, a library card \\ncatalog is a database that may be  created and maintained manually. A computerized database may be created \\nand maintained either by a group of application programs written specifically for that task or by a database \\nmanagement system. \\nA database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a \\ndatabase. \\nThe DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, \\nmanipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications. \\n \\nDefining a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the \\ndatabase. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database \\ncatalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data.  \\nConstructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. \\nManipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the \\ndatabase to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. \\nSharing a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously \\nAn application program accesses the database by sending queries or requests for data to the DBMS.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\nA query typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction may cause some data to be read and some data to be \\nwritten into the database. \\nOther important functions provided by the DBMS include protecting the database and maintaining it over a long period \\nof time. \\nProtection includes system protection against hardware or software malfunction (or crashes) and security protection \\nagainst unauthorized or malicious access.  \\nA typical large database may have a life cycle of many years, so the DBMS must be able to maintain the database system \\nby allowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time. \\nDatabase and DBMS software together a Database system. \\n \\nA simplified database system environment. \\n \\n \\nThe Information Technology (IT) department within a company designs and maintains an information system consisting \\nof various computers, storage systems, application software, and databases. Design of a new application for an existi ng \\ndatabase or design of a brand new database starts off with a phase called requirements specification and analysis . \\nThese requirements are documented in detail and transformed into a conceptual design that can be represented and \\nmanipulated using some co mputerized tools so that it can be easily maintained, modified, and transformed into a \\ndatabase implementation. The design is then translated to a logical design  that can be expressed in a data model \\nimplemented in a commercial DBMS. The final stage is phy sical design, during which further specifications are'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\nprovidedfor storing and accessing  the database. The database design is implemented, populated with actual data, and \\ncontinuously maintained to reflect the state of the miniworld. \\nCharacteristics of the Database Approach \\nIn traditional file processing, each user defines and implements the files needed for a specific software application as \\npart of programming the application. For example, one user, the grade reporting office, may keep files on students an d \\ntheir grades. Programs to print a student’s transcript and to enter new grades are implemented as part of the \\napplication. A second user, the accounting office, may keep track of students’ fees and their payments. Although both \\nusers are interested in da ta about students, each user maintains separate files — and programs to manipulate these \\nfiles—because each requires some data not available from the other user’s files. \\nThis redundancy in defining and storing data results in wasted storage space  and in redundant efforts  to maintain \\ncommon up-to-date data. \\nThe main characteristics of the database approach versus the file-processing approach are the following: \\n\\uf0fc Self-describing nature of a database system  \\n\\uf0fc Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction  \\n\\uf0fc Support of multiple views of the data  \\n\\uf0fc Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing \\n \\nSelf-Describing Nature of a Database System  \\nDB approach \\n\\uf0b7 A fundamental characteristic of the database a pproach is that the database system contains not only the \\ndatabase itself but also a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints. \\n\\uf0b7 This definition is stored in the DBMS catalog, which contains information such as the structu re of each file, the \\ntype and storage format of each data item, and various constraints on the data.  \\n\\uf0b7 The information stored in the catalog is calledmeta-data, and it describes the structure of the primary database. \\n\\uf0b7 Whenever a request is made to access, sa y, the Name of a STUDENT record, the DBMS software refers to the \\ncatalog to determine the structure of the STUDENT file and the position and size of the Name data item within a \\nSTUDENT record \\nTraditional file processing \\n\\uf0b7 In traditional file processing, data  definition is typically part of the application programs themselves. Hence, \\nthese programs are constrained to work with only one specific database, whose structure is declared in the \\napplication programs. \\n\\uf0b7 In a typical file -processing application, the file  structure and, in the extreme case, the exact location of Name \\nwithin a STUDENT record are already coded within each program that accesses this data item \\nInsulation between programs and data, and data abstraction \\n\\uf0b7 In traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in the application programs, so any changes \\nto the structure of a file may require changing all programs that access that file.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\n\\uf0b7 For example, a file access program may be written in such a way that it can access only STUDENT r ecords of the \\nstructure,If we want to add another piece of data to each STUDENT record, say the Birth_date, such a program \\nwill no longer work and must be changed \\n \\nDB approach \\n\\uf0b7 By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require such changes in most cases. The  structure of data files is \\nstored in the DBMS catalog separately from the access programs. We call this property program-data \\nindependence.  \\n\\uf0b7 By contrast, in a DBMS environment, we only need to change the description of STUDENT records in the catalog  \\nto reflect the inclusion of the new data item Birth_date; no programs are changed. The next time a DBMS \\nprogram refers to the catalog, the new structure of STUDENT records will be accessed and used \\n\\uf0fc In an object -oriented and object -relational systems, An operation (also called a function or method) is specified in \\ntwo parts. The interface (or signature) of an operation includes the operation name and the data types of its \\narguments (or parameters).  \\n\\uf0fc The implementation (or method) of the operation is specif ied separately and can be changed without affecting the \\ninterface. User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these operations through their names and \\narguments, regardless of how the operations are implemented. This may be termed program-operation \\nindependence. \\n\\uf0fc The characteristic that allows program-data independence and program -operation independence is called data \\nabstraction. \\nSupport of Multiple Views of the Data  \\n\\uf0b7 A database typically has many types of users, each of whom may require a different perspective or view of the \\ndatabase. \\n\\uf0b7  A view may be a subset of the database or it may contain virtual data that is derived from the database files but \\nis not explicitly stored.  \\n\\uf0b7 A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications must provide facilities for defining multiple \\nviews. \\n\\uf0b7 For example, one user of the database may be interested only in accessing and printing the transcript of each \\nstudent. A second user, who is interested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites of each \\ncourse for which the student registers, may require the view \\nSharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing \\n\\uf0b7 A multiuser DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access the database at the same time.  \\n\\uf0b7 This is essential if data for multiple applications is to be integrated and maintained in a single database.  \\n\\uf0b7 A fundamental role of multiuser DBMS software is to ensure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and \\nefficiently. \\n\\uf0b7 A transaction is an executing program or process that includes one or more database accesses, such as reading \\nor updating of database records.  \\n\\uf0b7 The DBMS must enforce several transaction properties. The isolation property ensures that each transaction \\nappears to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though hundreds of transactions may be executing \\nconcurrently. The atomicity property ensures that either all the database operations in a transaction are \\nexecuted or none are.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\nActors on the Scene \\nDatabase Administrators \\n\\uf0fc In a database environment, the primary resource is the database itself, and the secondary resource is the DBMS \\nand related software.  \\n\\uf0fc Administering these resources is the responsibility of the database administrator (DBA).  \\n\\uf0fc The DBA is responsible for authorizing access to the database, coordinating and monitoring its use, and \\nacquiring software and hardware resources as needed.  \\n\\uf0fc The DBA is accountable for problems such as security breaches and poor system response time. In large \\norganizations, the DBA is assisted by a staff that carries out these functions. \\nDatabase Designers  \\n\\uf0fc Database designers are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the database and for choosing \\nappropriate structures to represent and store this data. \\n\\uf0fc It is the responsibility of database designers to communicate with all prospective database users in order to \\nunderstand their requirements and to create a design that meets these requirements. \\n\\uf0fc  Database designers typically interact with each potential group of users and develop views of the database that \\nmeet the data and processing requirements of these groups. Each view is then analyzed and integrated with the \\nviews of other user groups. The final database design must be capable of supporting the requirements of all user \\ngroups. \\n \\n End Users  \\nEnd users are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating report. \\n There are several categories of end users:  \\n■Casual end users  occasionally access the database, but they may nee d different information each time. They use a \\nsophisticated database query language to specify their requests and are typically middle - or high -level managers or \\nother occasional browsers.  \\n■Naive or parametric end users  make up a sizable portion of databa se end users. Their main job function revolves \\naround constantly querying and updating the database, using standard types of queries and updates —calledcanned \\ntransactions—that have been carefully programmed and tested.  \\nThe tasks that such users perform are varied: \\n\\uf0fc Bank tellers check account balances and post withdrawals and deposits. \\n\\uf0fc Reservation agents for airlines, hotels, and car rental companies check availability for a given request and make \\nreservations. \\n\\uf0fc shipping clerks (e.g., at UPS) who use buttons, bar code scanners, etc., to update status of in-transit packages.  \\n■Sophisticated end users  include engineers, scientists, business analysts, and others who thoroughly familiarize \\nthemselves with the facilities of the DBMS in order to implement their own applications to meet their complex \\nrequirements.  \\n■Stand-alone users Use \"personal\" databases, possibly employing a special purpose (e.g., financial) software package. \\nMostly maintain personal databases using ready-to-use packaged applications. \\n An example is a tax program user that creates its own internal database.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\nAnother example is maintaining an address book \\nSystem Analysts, Application Programmers, Software Engineers: \\nSystem Analysts: determine needs of end users, especially naive and parametric users, and develop specifications for \\ncanned transactions that meet these needs.  \\nApplication Programmers: Implement, test, document, and maintain programs that satisfy the specifications mentioned \\nabove. \\n \\nWorkers behind the Scene \\nPersons are typically not interested in the database content itself known as workers behind the scene, and they include \\nthe following categories: \\nDBMS system designers and implementers  design and implement the DBMS mod ules and interfaces as a software \\npackage. \\nTool developers design and implement tools —the software packages that facilitate database modeling and design, \\ndatabase system design, and improved performance.They include packages for database design, performance \\nmonitoring, natural language or graphical interfaces, prototyping, simulation, and test data generation. \\nOperators and maintenance personnel  (system administration personnel) are responsible for the actual running and \\nmaintenance of the hardware and software environment for the database system. \\nAdvantages of Using the DBMS Approach \\n1. Controlling Redundancy: \\nData redundancy (such as tends to occur in the \"file processing\" approach) leads to wasted storage space, \\nduplication of effort (when multiple copies of a datum need to be updated), and a higher likelihood of the \\nintroduction of inconsistency. \\nOn the other hand, redundancy can be used to improve performance of queries. Indexes, for example, are \\nentirely redundant, but help the DBMS in processing queries more quickly. \\nA DBMS should provide the capability to automatically enforce the rule that no inconsistencies are introduced \\nwhen data is updated.  \\n2. Restricting Unauthorized Access: \\nA DBMS should provide a security and authorization subsystem, which the DBA uses to create accounts and to \\nspecify account restrictions. Then, the DBMS should enforce these restrictions automatically. \\n3. Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects: \\nObject-oriented database systems make it easier for complex runtime objects (e.g., lists, trees) to be saved in \\nsecondary storage so as to survive beyond program termination and to be retrievable at a later time. \\n4. Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing:  \\nDatabase systems must provide capabilities for efficiently executing queries and updates. The query processing \\nand optimization module of the DBMS is responsible for choosing an efficient query execution plan for each \\nquery based on the existing storage structures. \\n5. Providing Backup and Recovery: \\nA DBMS must provide facilities for recovering from hardware or software failures. The backup and recovery \\nsubsystem of the DBMS is responsible for recovery.  \\nThe recovery subsystem could ensure that the transaction is resumed from the point at which it was interrupted \\nso that its full effect is recorded in the database.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\n6. Providing Multiple User Interfaces: \\nMany types of users with varying levels of technical knowledge use a database, a DBMS should provide a variety \\nof user interfaces.For example, query languages for casual users, programming language interfaces for \\napplication programmers, forms and/or command codes for parametric users, menu-driven interfaces for stand-\\nalone users. \\n7. Representing Complex Relationships Among Data: \\nA DBMS must have the capability to represent a variety of complex relationships among the data, to define new \\nrelationships as they arise, and to retrieve and update related data easily and efficiently. \\n8. Enforcing Integrity Constraints: \\nMost database applications have certain integrity constraints that must hold for the data. \\nThe simplest type of integrity constraint involves specifying a data type for each data item. \\nA more complex type of constraint that frequently occurs involves specifying that a record in one file must be \\nrelated to records in other files.This is known as a referential integrity constraint. \\nAnother type of constraint specifies uniqueness on data item values, this is known as a key or uniqueness \\nconstraint. \\n9. Permitting Inferencing and Actions Via Rules:  \\nIn a deductive database system, one may specify declarative rules that allow the database to infer new data! \\nE.g.,  Figure out which students are on academic probation. Such capabilities would take the place of application \\nprograms that would be used to ascertain such information otherwise.  \\nActive database systems go one step further by allowing \"active rules\" that can be used to initiate actions \\nautomatically. \\n \\n \\n A Brief History of Database Applications \\n\\uf0b7 Early Database Applications:  \\n\\uf0fc The Hierarchical and Network Models were introduced in mid 1960s and dominated during the 70’s \\n\\uf0fc  A bulk of the worldwide database processing still occurs using these models \\n\\uf0b7 Relational Model based Systems:  \\n\\uf0fc Relational model was originally introduced in 1970, was heavily researched and experimented with in \\nIBM Research and several universities \\n                Object-oriented and emerging applications: Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMSs) were \\nintroduced in late 1980s and early 1990s to cater to the need of complex data processing in CAD and other \\napplications.  \\n\\uf0b7 Their use has not taken off much.  \\n                Many relational DBMSs have incorporated object database concepts, leading to a new category called object-\\nrelational DBMSs (ORDBMSs) \\n                Extended relational systems add further capabilities (e.g. for multimedia data, XML, and other data types) \\n\\uf0b7 Relational DBMS Products emerged in the 1980s \\n\\uf0b7  Data on the Web and E-commerce Applications \\n\\uf0b7  Web contains data in HTML (Hypertext markup language) with links among pages. \\n\\uf0b7 This has given rise to a new set of applications and E-commerce is using new standards like XML (eXtended \\nMarkup Language)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\n\\uf0b7  Script programming languages such as PHP and JavaScript allow generation of dynamic Web pages that are \\npartially generated from a database  \\n\\uf0b7  New functionality is being added to DBMSs in the following areas: \\n\\uf0fc Scientific Applications  \\n\\uf0fc  XML (extensible Markup Language)  \\n\\uf0fc  Image Storage and Management  \\n\\uf0fc Audio and Video data management  \\n\\uf0fc  Data Warehousing and Data Mining  \\n\\uf0fc  Spatial data management  \\n\\uf0fc  Time Series and Historical Data Management  \\n\\uf0fc The above gives rise to new research and development in incorporating new data types, complex data \\nstructures, new operations and storage and indexing schemes in database systems. \\n\\uf0fc Also allow database updates through Web pages \\n \\nWhen Not to Use a DBMS \\n\\uf0b7 Main inhibitors (costs) of using a DBMS:  \\n\\uf0fc High initial investment and possible need for additional hardware.  \\n\\uf0fc Overhead for providing generality, security, concurrency control, recovery, and integrity functions.  \\n\\uf0b7 When a DBMS may be unnecessary:  \\n\\uf0fc If the database and applications are simple, well defined, and not expected to change. \\n\\uf0fc  If there are stringent real-time requirements that may not be met because of DBMS overhead. \\n\\uf0fc  If access to data by multiple users is not required. \\n\\uf0b7 When no DBMS may suffice:  \\n\\uf0fc If the database system is not able to handle the complexity of data because of modeling limitations. \\n\\uf0fc  If the database users need special operations not supported by the DBMS.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\n \\nCHAPTER 2 \\nOVERVIEW OF DATABASE LANGUAGES AND ARCHITECTURES  \\nData Models, Schemas, and Instances \\nOne fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that it provides some level of data abstraction. \\n \\nData abstraction generally refers to the suppression of details of data organization and storage, and the highlighting of \\nthe essential features for an improved understanding of data. \\nOne of the main characteristics of the database approach is to support data abstraction so that different users can \\nperceive data at their preferred level of detail.  \\nA data model —a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database —provides the \\nnecessary means to achieve this abstraction \\nBy structure of a database means the data types, relationships, and constraints that apply to the data. Most data \\nmodels also include a set of basic operations for specifying retrievals and updates on the database. \\nCategories of Data Models \\n1. High-level or conceptual data models \\n     -provide concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data \\n     -use concepts such as entities, attributes, and relationships.  \\n\\uf0fc An entity represents a real-world object or concept, such as an employee or a project from the miniworld that is \\ndescribed in the database. \\n\\uf0fc An attribute represents some property of interest that further describes an entity, such as the employee’s name \\nor salary.  \\n\\uf0fc A relationship among two or more entities represents an association among the entities., for example, a works-\\non relationship between an employee and a project. \\n2.Low-level or physical data models \\n        - provide concepts that describe the details of how data is stored on the computer storage media, typically \\nmagnetic disks.  \\n        - Concepts provided by low-level data models are generally meant for computer specialists, not for end users \\n3. Representational (or implementation) data models \\n        - provide concepts that may be easily understood by end users but that are not too far removed from the way da ta \\nis organized in computer storage \\n       -in between high level and low level \\n        - hide many details of data storage on disk but can be implemented on a computer system directly \\nSchemas \\nThe description of a database is called the database schema , wh ich is specified during database design and is not \\nexpected to change frequently.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=\"Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\n A displayed schema is called a schema diagram \\nObject in the schema—such as STUDENT or COURSE—a schema construct \\nA schema diagram displays only some aspects of a schema, such as the names of record types and data items, and some \\ntypes of constraints. \\nThe actual data in a database may change quite frequently. Changes every time we add a new student or enter a new \\ngrade. \\n The data in the database at a particular moment in time i s called a database state or SNAPSHOT. It is also called the \\ncurrentset of occurrences or instances  in the database.. In a given database state, each schema construct has its own \\ncurrent set of instances; for example, the STUDENT construct will contain the  set of individual student entities (records) \\nas its instances. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nfig: Schema diagram for the University database \\nWhen we define a new database, we specify its database schema only to the DBMS. At this point, the corresponding \\ndatabase state is the empty state with no data. \\nWe get the initial state of the database when the database is first populated or loaded with the initial data. From then \\non, every time an update operation is applied to the database, we get another database state.  \\nAt any point in time, the database has a current state.  \\n The DBMS is partly responsible for ensuring that every state of the database is a valid state —that is, a state that \\nsatisfies the structure and constraints specified in the schema.  \\nThe DBMS stores the descriptions of the schema constructs and constraints—also called the meta-data—in the DBMS \\ncatalog . \\nThe schema is sometimes called the INTENSION, and a database state is called an EXTENSIONof the schema. \\nApplication requirements change occasionally, which is one o f the reasons why software maintenance is important. On \\nsuch occasions, a change to a database's schema may be called for. An example would be to add a Date_of_Birth \\nfield/attribute to the STUDENT table. Making changes to a database schema is known as SCHEMA EVOLUTION. Most \\nmodern DBMS's support schema evolution operations that can be applied while a database is operational.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.

The internal level has an internal schema,  \\n        -describes the physical storage structure of the database.  \\n        -uses a physical data model and describes the complete details of data storage and access paths for the \\ndatabase. \\n2.    The conceptual level has a conceptual schema,  \\n                      -describes the structure of the whole database for a community of users \\n                      -hides the details of physical storage structures and concentrates on describing entities, data types,     \\nrelationships, user operations, and constraints \\n                      -representational data model is used to desc ribe the conceptual schema when a database system is \\nimplemented \\n                      -This implementation conceptual schema is often based on a conceptual schema design in a high -level data  \\nmodel. \\n \\n3. The external or view level includes a number of external schemas or user views, \\n                     -describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the \\ndatabase from that user group.  \\n                    -As in the previous level, each external schema is  typically implemented using a representational data model, \\npossibly based on an external schema design in a high-level data model. \\n \\n  The DBMS must transform a request specified on an external schema into a request against the conceptual schema, \\nand then into a request on the internal schema for processing over the stored database.  \\n  If the request is a database retrieval, the data extracted from the stored database must be reformatted to match the \\nuser’s external view. The processes of transforming requests and results between levels are calledmappings.  \\n  These mappings may be time -consuming, so some DBMSs —especially those that are meant to support small \\ndatabases—do not support external views. \\n  Even in such systems, however, a certain amount of mapping  is necessary to transform requests between the \\nconceptual and internal levels.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \\nData Independence \\nData independence , which can be defined as the capacity to change the schema at one level of a database \\nsystem without having to change the schema at the next higher level.  \\n  We can define two types of data independence: \\n1. Logical data independence \\n          -capacity to change the conceptual schema without having to change external schemas or application \\nprograms \\n          -change the conceptual schema to expand the database, to change constraints, or to reduce the \\ndatabase \\n          -changes to constraints can be applied to the conceptual schema without affecting the external \\nschemas or application programs \\n            2.

Thus, the participation of EMPLOYEE in \\nWORKS_FOR is calledtotal participation, meaning that every entity in the total set of employee entities must \\nbe related to a department entity via WORKS_FOR. Total participation is also calledexistence dependency. \\n\\uf0fc we do not expect every employee to manage a department, so the participation of EMPLOYEE in the MANAGES \\nrelationship type is partial, meaning that some or part of the set of employee entities are related to some \\ndepartment entity via MANAGES, but not necessarily all \\n\\uf0fc In ER diagrams, total participation (or existence dependency) is displayed as a double line connecting the \\nparticipating entity type to the relationship, whereas partial participation is represented by a single line \\nAttributes of Relationship Types \\n\\uf0fc Relationship types can also have attributes, similar to those of entity types. \\n\\uf0fc For example, to record the number of hours per week that a particular employee works on a particular \\nproject, we can include an attribute Hours for the WORKS_ON relationship type \\n\\uf0fc to include the date on which a manager started managing a department via an attribute Start_date for the \\nMANAGES relationship type \\nWeak Entity Types \\n\\uf0fc Entity types that do not have key attributes of their own are called weak entity types \\n\\uf0fc   In contrast, regular entity types that do have a key attribute—are called strong entity types'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.

For example, suppose that each of several entity types in a UNIVERSITY database, suc h as STUDENT, \\nINSTRUCTOR, and COURSE, has an attribute Department in the initial design; the designer may then choose to \\ncreate an entity type DEPARTMENT with a single attribute Dept_name and relate it to the three entity types \\n(STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, and COURSE) via appropriate relationships \\n\\uf0fc An inverse refinement to the previous case may be applied —for example, if an entity type DEPARTMENT exists \\nin the initial design with a single attribute Dept_name and is related to only one other entity type, STUDENT.

Suppose that CAN_SUPPLY, \\nbetween SUPPLIER and PART, includes an instance (s, p) whenever supplier s can supply part p (to any project); \\nUSES, between PROJECT and PART, includes an instance (j, p) whenever project j uses part  p; and SUPPLIES, \\nbetween SUPPLIER and PROJECT, includes an instance (s, j) whenever supplier s supplies  some part to project j. \\nThe existence of three relationship instances (s, p), (j, p), and (s, j) in CAN_SUPPLY, USES, and SUPPLIES, \\nrespectively, does not necessarily imply that an instance (s, j, p) exists in the ternary relationship SUPPLY, \\nbecause the meaning is different. \\n\\uf0fc It is often tricky to decide whether a particular relationship should be represented as a relationship type of \\ndegree n or should be broken down into several relationship types of smaller degrees  \\n\\uf0fc The designer must base this decision on the semantics or meaning of the particular situation being represented'), Document(metadata={'source': 'notes.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='Module 1 \\nSUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \\nAsst.

      "Introduction \n",
      "A database is a collection of related data. \n",
      "A data mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. \n",
      "For eg, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. You may have recorded this \n",
      "data in an indexed address book or you may have stored it on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such \n",
      "as Microsoft Access or Excel. This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database. \n",
      "A database has the following implicit properties: \n",
      " A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld or the universe \n",
      "ofdiscourse (UoD). Changes to the miniworldare reflected in the database.  \n",
      " A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data \n",
      "cannot correctly be referred to as a database. \n",
      " A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users \n",
      "and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested. \n",
      "Other properties: \n",
      " A database can be of any size and complexity .For example, the list of names and addresses referred to earlier \n",
      "may consist o f only a few hundred records, each with a simple structure.An example of a large commercial \n",
      "database is Amazon.com. \n",
      " A database may be generated and maintained manually or it may be computerized . For example, a library card \n",
      "catalog is a database that may be  created and maintained manually. A computerized database may be created \n",
      "and maintained either by a group of application programs written specifically for that task or by a database \n",
      "management system. \n",
      "A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a \n",
      "database. \n",
      "The DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, \n",
      "manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications. \n",
      " \n",
      "Defining a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the \n",
      "database. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database \n",
      "catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data.  \n",
      "Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. \n",
      "Manipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the \n",
      "database to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. \n",

      "Characteristics of the Database Approach \n",
      "In traditional file processing, each user defines and implements the files needed for a specific software application as \n",
      "part of programming the application. For example, one user, the grade reporting office, may keep files on students an d \n",
      "their grades. Programs to print a student’s transcript and to enter new grades are implemented as part of the \n",
      "application. A second user, the accounting office, may keep track of students’ fees and their payments. Although both \n",
      "users are interested in da ta about students, each user maintains separate files — and programs to manipulate these \n",
      "files—because each requires some data not available from the other user’s files. \n",
      "This redundancy in defining and storing data results in wasted storage space  and in redundant efforts  to maintain \n",
      "common up-to-date data. \n",
      "The main characteristics of the database approach versus the file-processing approach are the following: \n",
      " Self-describing nature of a database system  \n",
      " Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction  \n",
      " Support of multiple views of the data  \n",
      " Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing \n",
      " \n",
      "Self-Describing Nature of a Database System  \n",
      "DB approach \n",
      " A fundamental characteristic of the database a pproach is that the database system contains not only the \n",
      "database itself but also a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints. \n",
      " This definition is stored in the DBMS catalog, which contains information such as the structu re of each file, the \n",
      "type and storage format of each data item, and various constraints on the data.  \n",
      " The information stored in the catalog is calledmeta-data, and it describes the structure of the primary database. \n",
      " Whenever a request is made to access, sa y, the Name of a STUDENT record, the DBMS software refers to the \n",
      "catalog to determine the structure of the STUDENT file and the position and size of the Name data item within a \n",
      "STUDENT record \n",
      "Traditional file processing \n",
      " In traditional file processing, data  definition is typically part of the application programs themselves. Hence, \n",
      "these programs are constrained to work with only one specific database, whose structure is declared in the \n",
      "application programs. \n",
      " In a typical file -processing application, the file  structure and, in the extreme case, the exact location of Name \n",
      "within a STUDENT record are already coded within each program that accesses this data item \n",
      "Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction \n",
      " In traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in the application programs, so any changes \n",
      "to the structure of a file may require changing all programs that access that file.\n",

      "The database approach differs from traditional file processing in several key characteristics. One of the main advantages of the database approach is its self-describing nature, where the database system contains a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints. This allows for insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction, where multiple views of the data can be supported.

      "structure,If we want to add another piece of data to each STUDENT record, say the Birth_date, such a program \n",
      "will no longer work and must be changed \n",
      " \n",
      "DB approach \n",
      " By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require such changes in most cases. The  structure of data files is \n",
      "stored in the DBMS catalog separately from the access programs. We call this property program-data \n",
      "independence.  \n",
      " By contrast, in a DBMS environment, we only need to change the description of STUDENT records in the catalog  \n",
      "to reflect the inclusion of the new data item Birth_date; no programs are changed. The next time a DBMS \n",
      "program refers to the catalog, the new structure of STUDENT records will be accessed and used \n",
      " In an object -oriented and object -relational systems, An operation (also called a function or method) is specified in \n",
      "two parts. The interface (or signature) of an operation includes the operation name and the data types of its \n",
      "arguments (or parameters).  \n",
      " The implementation (or method) of the operation is specif ied separately and can be changed without affecting the \n",
      "interface. User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these operations through their names and \n",
      "arguments, regardless of how the operations are implemented. This may be termed program-operation \n",
      "independence. \n",
      " The characteristic that allows program-data independence and program -operation independence is called data \n",
      "abstraction. \n",
      "Support of Multiple Views of the Data  \n",
      " A database typically has many types of users, each of whom may require a different perspective or view of the \n",
      "database. \n",
      "  A view may be a subset of the database or it may contain virtual data that is derived from the database files but \n",
      "is not explicitly stored.  \n",
      " A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications must provide facilities for defining multiple \n",
      "views. \n",
      " For example, one user of the database may be interested only in accessing and printing the transcript of each \n",
      "student. A second user, who is interested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites of each \n",
      "course for which the student registers, may require the view \n",
      "Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing \n",
      " A multiuser DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access the database at the same time.  \n",
      " This is essential if data for multiple applications is to be integrated and maintained in a single database.  \n",
      " A fundamental role of multiuser DBMS software is to ensure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and \n",
      "efficiently. \n",
      " A transaction is an executing program or process that includes one or more database accesses, such as reading \n",
      "or updating of database records.  \n",
      " The DBMS must enforce several transaction properties. The isolation property ensures that each transaction \n",
      "appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though hundreds of transactions may be executing \n",
      "concurrently. The atomicity property ensures that either all the database operations in a transaction are \n",
      "executed or none are.\n",

      "A database is a collection of related data that represents a specific aspect of the real world, with inherent meaning and designed for a specific purpose. It can be manual or computerized, and is managed by a Database Management System (DBMS) that enables users to define, construct, manipulate, and share the database. The DBMS stores descriptive information (metadata) and facilitates querying, updating, and reporting. In addition to retrieving and updating data, a DBMS also provides important functions such as protecting the database from hardware or software malfunctions and security threats, and maintaining the database over a long period of time as requirements change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The database approach differs from traditional file processing in several key characteristics. One of the main advantages of the database approach is its self-describing nature, where the database system contains a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints. This allows for insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction, where multiple views of the data can be supported. This insulation enables sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In traditional file processing, data definition is typically part of the application programs themselves, which limits the flexibility and scalability of the system. In contrast, the database approach separates the data definition from the application programs, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability. The DBMS catalog stores metadata, which describes the structure of the primary database, allowing for easier management and maintenance of the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design of a database system involves several stages, including requirements specification and analysis, conceptual design, logical design, and physical design. The database design is implemented, populated with actual data, and continuously maintained to reflect the state of the miniworld.\n",
      "\n",
      "Program-data independence, program-operation independence, and data abstraction are key characteristics of a DBMS. Program-data independence allows changes to the database structure without affecting the application programs. Program-operation independence allows changes to the implementation of operations without affecting the interface. Data abstraction enables users to access and manipulate data without knowing the underlying implementation details.\n",
      "\n",
      "A DBMS also supports multiple views of the data, which allows different users to access and manipulate the data in different ways. This is achieved through the creation of views, which are virtual tables or queries that provide a subset of the data or a specific perspective on the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a DBMS must also support multi-user transaction processing, which ensures that multiple users can access and manipulate the data concurrently without conflicts or inconsistencies. The DBMS ensures that each transaction appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, and that either all the database operations in a transaction are executed or none are.\n",

      " End Users  \n",
      "End users are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating report. \n",
      " There are several categories of end users:  \n",
      "■Casual end users  occasionally access the database, but they may nee d different information each time. They use a \n",

      "Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach \n",
      "1. Controlling Redundancy: \n",
      "Data redundancy (such as tends to occur in the \"file processing\" approach) leads to wasted storage space, \n",
      "duplication of effort (when multiple copies of a datum need to be updated), and a higher likelihood of the \n",
      "introduction of inconsistency. \n",
      "On the other hand, redundancy can be used to improve performance of queries. Indexes, for example, are \n",
      "entirely redundant, but help the DBMS in processing queries more quickly. \n",
      "A DBMS should provide the capability to automatically enforce the rule that no inconsistencies are introduced \n",
      "when data is updated.  \n",
      "2. Restricting Unauthorized Access: \n",
      "A DBMS should provide a security and authorization subsystem, which the DBA uses to create accounts and to \n",
      "specify account restrictions. Then, the DBMS should enforce these restrictions automatically. \n",
      "3. Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects: \n",
      "Object-oriented database systems make it easier for complex runtime objects (e.g., lists, trees) to be saved in \n",
      "secondary storage so as to survive beyond program termination and to be retrievable at a later time. \n",
      "4. Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing:  \n",
      "Database systems must provide capabilities for efficiently executing queries and updates. The query processing \n",
      "and optimization module of the DBMS is responsible for choosing an efficient query execution plan for each \n",
      "query based on the existing storage structures. \n",
      "5. Providing Backup and Recovery: \n",
      "A DBMS must provide facilities for recovering from hardware or software failures. The backup and recovery \n",
      "subsystem of the DBMS is responsible for recovery.  \n",
      "The recovery subsystem could ensure that the transaction is resumed from the point at which it was interrupted \n",

      "8. Enforcing Integrity Constraints: \n",
      "Most database applications have certain integrity constraints that must hold for the data. \n",
      "The simplest type of integrity constraint involves specifying a data type for each data item. \n",
      "A more complex type of constraint that frequently occurs involves specifying that a record in one file must be \n",

      "Another type of constraint specifies uniqueness on data item values, this is known as a key or uniqueness \n",
      "constraint. \n",
      "9. Permitting Inferencing and Actions Via Rules:  \n",
      "In a deductive database system, one may specify declarative rules that allow the database to infer new data! \n",
      "E.g.,  Figure out which students are on academic probation. Such capabilities would take the place of application \n",
      "programs that would be used to ascertain such information otherwise.  \n",

      "One fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that it provides some level of data abstraction. \n",
      " \n",
      "Data abstraction generally refers to the suppression of details of data organization and storage, and the highlighting of \n",
      "the essential features for an improved understanding of data. \n",
      "One of the main characteristics of the database approach is to support data abstraction so that different users can \n",
      "perceive data at their preferred level of detail.  \n",
      "A data model —a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database —provides the \n",
      "necessary means to achieve this abstraction \n",
      "By structure of a database means the data types, relationships, and constraints that apply to the data. Most data \n",
      "models also include a set of basic operations for specifying retrievals and updates on the database. \n",
      "Categories of Data Models \n",
      "1. High-level or conceptual data models \n",
      "     -provide concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data \n",
      "     -use concepts such as entities, attributes, and relationships.  \n",
      " An entity represents a real-world object or concept, such as an employee or a project from the miniworld that is \n",
      "described in the database. \n",
      " An attribute represents some property of interest that further describes an entity, such as the employee’s name \n",
      "or salary.  \n",
      " A relationship among two or more entities represents an association among the entities., for example, a works-\n",
      "on relationship between an employee and a project. \n",
      "2.Low-level or physical data models \n",
      "        - provide concepts that describe the details of how data is stored on the computer storage media, typically \n",
      "magnetic disks.  \n",
      "        - Concepts provided by low-level data models are generally meant for computer specialists, not for end users \n",

      " Requirements Collection and Analysis: purpose is to produce a description of the users' requirements.  \n",
      " Conceptual Design: purpose is to produce a conceptual schema for the database, including detailed descriptions \n",
      "of entity types, relationship types, and constraints. All these are expressed in terms provided by the data model \n",
      "being used. Eg: ER model  \n",
      " Implementation: purpose is to transform the conceptual schema (which is at a high/abstract level) into a (lower-\n",
      "level) representational/implementational model supported by whatever DBMS is to be used.  \n",
      " Physical Design: purpose is to decide upon the internal storage structures, access paths (indexes), etc., that will \n",
      "be used in realizing the representational model produced in previous phase.\n",

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: Based on the provided context, I have refined the original summary to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a Database Management System (DBMS) and its management system.\n",
      "\n",
      "A DBMS manages and manipulates complex data, enabling users to access and manipulate the data in a flexible and scalable manner. The DBMS provides multiple user interfaces, including query languages, programming language interfaces, forms and/or command codes, and menu-driven interfaces, as well as various forms-based interfaces, graphical user interfaces, natural language interfaces, speech input and output, interfaces for parametric users, and interfaces for the DBA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS must represent complex relationships among data, including referential integrity constraints, key or uniqueness constraints, and the ability to define new relationships as they arise. It should also permit inferencing and actions via rules, allowing for the automatic initiation of actions based on specific conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS provides several advantages, including controlling redundancy, restricting unauthorized access, providing persistent storage for program objects, providing storage structures and search techniques for efficient query processing, and providing backup and recovery capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS has its own buffer management module to schedule disk read/write, and stored data manager controls access to DBMS information that is stored on disk, whether it is part of the database or the catalog. The DBA staff works on defining the database and tuning it by making changes to its definition using the DDL and other privileged commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS also provides various utilities for managing the database system, such as loading, backup, database storage reorganization, and performance monitoring. Additionally, it provides tools for design, development, and maintenance of database applications, including CASE tools, data dictionaries, information repositories, application development environments, and communications software.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of architecture, the DBMS has evolved to accommodate different architectures, including centralized and client/server architectures. The client/server architecture, as described in Module 1, is a key aspect of DBMS architecture, where specialized servers provide specific functionalities and client machines access these resources. This architecture enables efficient use of resources and provides flexibility in designing and implementing database applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS plays a crucial role in transforming requests and results between levels, and provides multiple interfaces and languages to cater to various types of users. The DBMS also improves database security by checking a client's credentials before forwarding a request to the database server. Clients contain GUI interfaces and some additional application-specific business rules. The intermediate server accepts requests from the client, processes the request, and sends database queries and commands to the database server, and then acts as a conduit for passing (partially) processed data from the database server to the clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS provides various classification criteria, such as data models (relational, object, hierarchical, and network), number of users (single-user and multi-user), number of sites (centralized, distributed, homogeneous, and heterogeneous), and cost (open source and licensed). Moreover, it provides different types of access paths, including inverted file structures, general-purpose, and special-purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, a DBMS provides a comprehensive solution for managing and manipulating complex data, enabling users to access and manipulate the data in a flexible and scalable manner. The DBMS plays a crucial role in transforming requests and results between levels, and provides multiple interfaces and languages to cater to various types of users, all while accommodating different architectures to meet the needs of different applications and users.\n",

      "Introduction to Databases \n",
      "Introduction \n",
      "A database is a collection of related data. \n",
      "A data mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. \n",
      "For eg, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. You may have recorded this \n",
      "data in an indexed address book or you may have stored it on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such \n",
      "as Microsoft Access or Excel. This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database. \n",
      "A database has the following implicit properties: \n",
      " A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld or the universe \n",
      "ofdiscourse (UoD). Changes to the miniworldare reflected in the database.  \n",
      " A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data \n",
      "cannot correctly be referred to as a database. \n",
      " A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users \n",
      "and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested. \n",
      "Other properties: \n",
      " A database can be of any size and complexity .For example, the list of names and addresses referred to earlier \n",
      "may consist o f only a few hundred records, each with a simple structure.An example of a large commercial \n",
      "database is Amazon.com. \n",
      " A database may be generated and maintained manually or it may be computerized . For example, a library card \n",
      "catalog is a database that may be  created and maintained manually. A computerized database may be created \n",
      "and maintained either by a group of application programs written specifically for that task or by a database \n",
      "management system. \n",
      "A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a \n",
      "database. \n",
      "The DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, \n",
      "manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications. \n",
      " \n",
      "Defining a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the \n",
      "database. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database \n",
      "catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data.  \n",
      "Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. \n",
      "Manipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the \n",
      "database to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. \n",
      "Sharing a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously \n",
      "An application program accesses the database by sending queries or requests for data to the DBMS.\"\n",

      "Characteristics of the Database Approach \n",
      "In traditional file processing, each user defines and implements the files needed for a specific software application as \n",
      "part of programming the application. For example, one user, the grade reporting office, may keep files on students an d \n",
      "their grades. Programs to print a student’s transcript and to enter new grades are implemented as part of the \n",
      "application. A second user, the accounting office, may keep track of students’ fees and their payments. Although both \n",
      "users are interested in da ta about students, each user maintains separate files — and programs to manipulate these \n",
      "files—because each requires some data not available from the other user’s files. \n",
      "This redundancy in defining and storing data results in wasted storage space  and in redundant efforts  to maintain \n",
      "common up-to-date data. \n",
      "The main characteristics of the database approach versus the file-processing approach are the following: \n",
      " Self-describing nature of a database system  \n",
      " Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction  \n",
      " Support of multiple views of the data  \n",
      " Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing \n",
      " \n",
      "Self-Describing Nature of a Database System  \n",
      "DB approach \n",
      " A fundamental characteristic of the database a pproach is that the database system contains not only the \n",
      "database itself but also a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints. \n",
      " This definition is stored in the DBMS catalog, which contains information such as the structu re of each file, the \n",
      "type and storage format of each data item, and various constraints on the data.  \n",
      " The information stored in the catalog is calledmeta-data, and it describes the structure of the primary database. \n",
      " Whenever a request is made to access, sa y, the Name of a STUDENT record, the DBMS software refers to the \n",
      "catalog to determine the structure of the STUDENT file and the position and size of the Name data item within a \n",
      "STUDENT record \n",
      "Traditional file processing \n",
      " In traditional file processing, data  definition is typically part of the application programs themselves. Hence, \n",
      "these programs are constrained to work with only one specific database, whose structure is declared in the \n",
      "application programs. \n",
      " In a typical file -processing application, the file  structure and, in the extreme case, the exact location of Name \n",
      "within a STUDENT record are already coded within each program that accesses this data item \n",
      "Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction \n",
      " In traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in the application programs, so any changes \n",
      "to the structure of a file may require changing all programs that access that file.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Module 1 \n",
      "SUMARANI H  & VANITHA H N  \n",
      "Asst.  Professor, Dept of CSE,CBIT, Kolar. \n",
      " For example, a file access program may be written in such a way that it can access only STUDENT r ecords of the \n",
      "structure,If we want to add another piece of data to each STUDENT record, say the Birth_date, such a program \n",
      "will no longer work and must be changed \n",
      " \n",
      "DB approach \n",
      " By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require such changes in most cases. The  structure of data files is \n",
      "stored in the DBMS catalog separately from the access programs. We call this property program-data \n",
      "independence.  \n",
      " By contrast, in a DBMS environment, we only need to change the description of STUDENT records in the catalog  \n",
      "to reflect the inclusion of the new data item Birth_date; no programs are changed. The next time a DBMS \n",
      "program refers to the catalog, the new structure of STUDENT records will be accessed and used \n",
      " In an object -oriented and object -relational systems, An operation (also called a function or method) is specified in \n",
      "two parts. The interface (or signature) of an operation includes the operation name and the data types of its \n",
      "arguments (or parameters).  \n",
      " The implementation (or method) of the operation is specif ied separately and can be changed without affecting the \n",
      "interface. User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these operations through their names and \n",
      "arguments, regardless of how the operations are implemented. This may be termed program-operation \n",
      "independence. \n",
      " The characteristic that allows program-data independence and program -operation independence is called data \n",
      "abstraction. \n",
      "Support of Multiple Views of the Data  \n",
      " A database typically has many types of users, each of whom may require a different perspective or view of the \n",
      "database. \n",
      "  A view may be a subset of the database or it may contain virtual data that is derived from the database files but \n",
      "is not explicitly stored.  \n",
      " A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications must provide facilities for defining multiple \n",
      "views. \n",
      " For example, one user of the database may be interested only in accessing and printing the transcript of each \n",
      "student. A second user, who is interested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites of each \n",
      "course for which the student registers, may require the view \n",
      "Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing \n",
      " A multiuser DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access the database at the same time.  \n",
      " This is essential if data for multiple applications is to be integrated and maintained in a single database.  \n",
      " A fundamental role of multiuser DBMS software is to ensure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and \n",
      "efficiently. \n",
      " A transaction is an executing program or process that includes one or more database accesses, such as reading \n",
      "or updating of database records.  \n",
      " The DBMS must enforce several transaction properties. The isolation property ensures that each transaction \n",
      "appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though hundreds of transactions may be executing \n",
      "concurrently. The atomicity property ensures that either all the database operations in a transaction are \n",
      "executed or none are.\"\n",

      "understand their requirements and to create a design that meets these requirements. \n",
      "  Database designers typically interact with each potential group of users and develop views of the database that \n",
      "meet the data and processing requirements of these groups. Each view is then analyzed and integrated with the \n",
      "views of other user groups. The final database design must be capable of supporting the requirements of all user \n",

      " \n",
      " End Users  \n",
      "End users are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating report. \n",
      " There are several categories of end users:  \n",
      "■Casual end users  occasionally access the database, but they may nee d different information each time. They use a \n",
      "sophisticated database query language to specify their requests and are typically middle - or high -level managers or \n",
      "other occasional browsers.  \n",
      "■Naive or parametric end users  make up a sizable portion of databa se end users. Their main job function revolves \n",
      "around constantly querying and updating the database, using standard types of queries and updates —calledcanned \n",
      "transactions—that have been carefully programmed and tested.  \n",
      "The tasks that such users perform are varied: \n",
      " Bank tellers check account balances and post withdrawals and deposits. \n",
      " Reservation agents for airlines, hotels, and car rental companies check availability for a given request and make \n",
      "reservations. \n",
      " shipping clerks (e.g., at UPS) who use buttons, bar code scanners, etc., to update status of in-transit packages.  \n",
      "■Sophisticated end users  include engineers, scientists, business analysts, and others who thoroughly familiarize \n",
      "themselves with the facilities of the DBMS in order to implement their own applications to meet their complex \n",
      "requirements.  \n",
      "■Stand-alone users Use \"personal\" databases, possibly employing a special purpose (e.g., financial) software package. \n",
      "Mostly maintain personal databases using ready-to-use packaged applications. \n",
      " An example is a tax program user that creates its own internal database.\"\n",

      "Workers behind the Scene \n",
      "Persons are typically not interested in the database content itself known as workers behind the scene, and they include \n",
      "the following categories: \n",
      "DBMS system designers and implementers  design and implement the DBMS mod ules and interfaces as a software \n",
      "package. \n",
      "Tool developers design and implement tools —the software packages that facilitate database modeling and design, \n",
      "database system design, and improved performance.They include packages for database design, performance \n",
      "monitoring, natural language or graphical interfaces, prototyping, simulation, and test data generation. \n",
      "Operators and maintenance personnel  (system administration personnel) are responsible for the actual running and \n",
      "maintenance of the hardware and software environment for the database system. \n",
      "Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach \n",
      "1. Controlling Redundancy: \n",
      "Data redundancy (such as tends to occur in the \"file processing\" approach) leads to wasted storage space, \n",
      "duplication of effort (when multiple copies of a datum need to be updated), and a higher likelihood of the \n",
      "introduction of inconsistency. \n",
      "On the other hand, redundancy can be used to improve performance of queries. Indexes, for example, are \n",
      "entirely redundant, but help the DBMS in processing queries more quickly. \n",
      "A DBMS should provide the capability to automatically enforce the rule that no inconsistencies are introduced \n",
      "when data is updated.  \n",
      "2. Restricting Unauthorized Access: \n",
      "A DBMS should provide a security and authorization subsystem, which the DBA uses to create accounts and to \n",
      "specify account restrictions. Then, the DBMS should enforce these restrictions automatically. \n",
      "3. Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects: \n",
      "Object-oriented database systems make it easier for complex runtime objects (e.g., lists, trees) to be saved in \n",
      "secondary storage so as to survive beyond program termination and to be retrievable at a later time. \n",
      "4. Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing:  \n",
      "Database systems must provide capabilities for efficiently executing queries and updates. The query processing \n",
      "and optimization module of the DBMS is responsible for choosing an efficient query execution plan for each \n",
      "query based on the existing storage structures. \n",
      "5. Providing Backup and Recovery: \n",
      "A DBMS must provide facilities for recovering from hardware or software failures. The backup and recovery \n",
      "subsystem of the DBMS is responsible for recovery.  \n",
      "The recovery subsystem could ensure that the transaction is resumed from the point at which it was interrupted \n",
      "so that its full effect is recorded in the database.\"\n",

      "6. Providing Multiple User Interfaces: \n",
      "Many types of users with varying levels of technical knowledge use a database, a DBMS should provide a variety \n",
      "of user interfaces.For example, query languages for casual users, programming language interfaces for \n",
      "application programmers, forms and/or command codes for parametric users, menu-driven interfaces for stand-\n",
      "alone users. \n",
      "7. Representing Complex Relationships Among Data: \n",
      "A DBMS must have the capability to represent a variety of complex relationships among the data, to define new \n",
      "relationships as they arise, and to retrieve and update related data easily and efficiently. \n",
      "8. Enforcing Integrity Constraints: \n",
      "Most database applications have certain integrity constraints that must hold for the data. \n",
      "The simplest type of integrity constraint involves specifying a data type for each data item. \n",
      "A more complex type of constraint that frequently occurs involves specifying that a record in one file must be \n",
      "related to records in other files.This is known as a referential integrity constraint. \n",
      "Another type of constraint specifies uniqueness on data item values, this is known as a key or uniqueness \n",
      "constraint. \n",
      "9. Permitting Inferencing and Actions Via Rules:  \n",
      "In a deductive database system, one may specify declarative rules that allow the database to infer new data! \n",
      "E.g.,  Figure out which students are on academic probation. Such capabilities would take the place of application \n",
      "programs that would be used to ascertain such information otherwise.  \n",
      "Active database systems go one step further by allowing \"active rules\" that can be used to initiate actions \n",
      "automatically. \n",

      " The Hierarchical and Network Models were introduced in mid 1960s and dominated during the 70’s \n",
      "  A bulk of the worldwide database processing still occurs using these models \n",
      " Relational Model based Systems:  \n",
      " Relational model was originally introduced in 1970, was heavily researched and experimented with in \n",
      "IBM Research and several universities \n",
      "                Object-oriented and emerging applications: Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMSs) were \n",

      " Their use has not taken off much.  \n",
      "                Many relational DBMSs have incorporated object database concepts, leading to a new category called object-\n",

      " Relational DBMS Products emerged in the 1980s \n",
      "  Data on the Web and E-commerce Applications \n",
      "  Web contains data in HTML (Hypertext markup language) with links among pages. \n",

      "Data Models, Schemas, and Instances \n",
      "One fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that it provides some level of data abstraction. \n",
      " \n",
      "Data abstraction generally refers to the suppression of details of data organization and storage, and the highlighting of \n",
      "the essential features for an improved understanding of data. \n",
      "One of the main characteristics of the database approach is to support data abstraction so that different users can \n",
      "perceive data at their preferred level of detail.  \n",
      "A data model —a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database —provides the \n",
      "necessary means to achieve this abstraction \n",
      "By structure of a database means the data types, relationships, and constraints that apply to the data. Most data \n",
      "models also include a set of basic operations for specifying retrievals and updates on the database. \n",
      "Categories of Data Models \n",
      "1. High-level or conceptual data models \n",
      "     -provide concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data \n",
      "     -use concepts such as entities, attributes, and relationships.  \n",
      " An entity represents a real-world object or concept, such as an employee or a project from the miniworld that is \n",
      "described in the database. \n",
      " An attribute represents some property of interest that further describes an entity, such as the employee’s name \n",
      "or salary.  \n",
      " A relationship among two or more entities represents an association among the entities., for example, a works-\n",
      "on relationship between an employee and a project. \n",
      "2.Low-level or physical data models \n",
      "        - provide concepts that describe the details of how data is stored on the computer storage media, typically \n",
      "magnetic disks.  \n",
      "        - Concepts provided by low-level data models are generally meant for computer specialists, not for end users \n",
      "3. Representational (or implementation) data models \n",
      "        - provide concepts that may be easily understood by end users but that are not too far removed from the way da ta \n",
      "is organized in computer storage \n",
      "       -in between high level and low level \n",
      "        - hide many details of data storage on disk but can be implemented on a computer system directly \n",
      "Schemas \n",

      "The actual data in a database may change quite frequently. Changes every time we add a new student or enter a new \n",

      " The data in the database at a particular moment in time i s called a database state or SNAPSHOT. It is also called the \n",
      "currentset of occurrences or instances  in the database.. In a given database state, each schema construct has its own \n",

      "When we define a new database, we specify its database schema only to the DBMS. At this point, the corresponding \n",

      "We get the initial state of the database when the database is first populated or loaded with the initial data. From then \n",
      "on, every time an update operation is applied to the database, we get another database state.  \n",
      "At any point in time, the database has a current state.  \n",
      " The DBMS is partly responsible for ensuring that every state of the database is a valid state —that is, a state that \n",

      "                      -hides the details of physical storage structures and concentrates on describing entities, data types,     \n",
      "relationships, user operations, and constraints \n",

      "model. \n",
      " \n",
      "3. The external or view level includes a number of external schemas or user views, \n",
      "                     -describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the \n",
